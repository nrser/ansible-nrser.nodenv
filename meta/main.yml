# TODO  Getting rid of nrser.profile, replaced with the nrser.env/support/bash
#       stuff, which should have some sort of roles or whatever for adding 
#       things at some point, and is *designed* to be much easier for programs
#       to manipulate than a bash source file.
# 
# - role: nrser.profile
#   profile_pre:
#     nodenv: |
#       # init before everything else so that user paths supercede shims
#       export PATH="$HOME/.nodenv/bin:$PATH"
#       type nodenv > /dev/null 2>&1 && eval "$(nodenv init -)"
